To use the program, just run the commands "make all" followed by "./main.byte". To zoom into an area, just click on the screen once and then again to denote the area. Press 'q' to quit or 'e' to enhance the picture. Enhancing is done automatically as the user zooms by increasing the max number of iterations.
